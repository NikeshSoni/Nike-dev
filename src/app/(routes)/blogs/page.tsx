        🚀 From Freelance Projects to Full-Stack Innovation: My Journey as a MERN Developer
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I’m <strong>Nikesh Rajbhar</strong>, a passionate MERN Stack Developer driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning.
        My journey into the world of web development has been anything but ordinary. From transforming static sites into dynamic, responsive platforms to diving deep into full-stack technologies, every step has been a leap forward.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">🎯 Where It All Started</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My career kicked off with hands-on experience as a <strong>Web Development Intern at iBricks</strong>, where I learned the value of clean code and collaborative work.
        I built websites using React and C# in Microsoft Visual Studio, and actively participated in testing, debugging, and reviewing code with the team.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">💡 From Intern to Innovator</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        During my time at <strong>EazyByts Web Solutions</strong>, I developed full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
        At <strong>Infinx Pvt Ltd</strong>, I worked as a <strong>Pre-Authorization Analyst</strong>, which helped sharpen my analytical thinking, documentation, and communication—skills I now bring to every line of code I write.
